Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. 
It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. 
Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, 
explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need.
A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.


# Monkees Responsive Website Project

### What does it do?

This project uses skills learnt to build a mobile-first responsive Website for the 60's band The Monkees.
It fulfils the need for fans and potential fans to listen to The Monkees music, watch a music video, join a fan club, enquire through a contact form to hire the band 
as well as view pictures related to the band members and album cover artwork.

### Functionality of project

The website is fully responsive, on desktop and larger screen sizes there is a small amount of additional content (one picture on the header).
The navigation is functional and two forms (join the fan club and hire us) are input validated which then resolves to a respective thankyou page. These forms are not fully functional in that they don't alert anyone from the Webteam that a form has being filled nor do they fill a database.  Currently the hire-us form thankyou page does work on my local desktop but not on github pages, I believe this is due to appending PUSH data on the URL which github pages disallows due to injection risk.
